# SayThanks.io: Thankfulness for Open Source

**This project is a work in progress.**

SayThanks will exist as a thankfulness button/link/inbox for open source
projects to add to their repositories and documentation ‚Äî like a reverse
mailing list for users to send little notes of thanks for building something
awesome.

## Implementation Concepts

- Flask for API and Frontend (possibly single-app)
- Stormpath for credential storage
- GitHub account creation (as well as manual username)
- Email a when a new message of thankfulness is submitted (csrf enabled)
- Inbox page for each user/project with simple aggregation of messages (private).

## Intended Collaborators

- Erin "X" O'Connell (Python)
- Tom Baker (Javascript)
- Tom Matthews (Logo and Graphic Design)
- me‚Äîhopefully not  (Frontend Design)

## Other Places

- [Say Thanks for Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/say_thanks)

## Oh, Thanks!

By the way... :)
